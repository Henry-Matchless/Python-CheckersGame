>>>The Rules for Checkers

Checkers is a fun game for both beginers and experts.
Checkers is an ancient and fun game, where players must 
capture or stop the movement of all of their opponentâ€™s pieces. 
Getting one of the checkers to the other side of the board makes it a "king," 
meaning it can jump forward and backwards. 
Single checkers can still jump over kings, just as they can jump over single checkers.
The rules are simple, but the strategies can be intricate and engaging.
